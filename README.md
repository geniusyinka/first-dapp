# First Dapp!

source code of my first full-stack dApp deployed on the Ethereum testnet!



This project exposes me to the basic Hardhat use case. I've wrote a simple smart contract that takes in 'waves' from users and displays them as well as a handful of information as well.

This project also exposes me to the fundamentals of reading and wriitng data to the ethereum blockchain, and also built out a front-end user interface that communicates with the block-chain written in reactJs.
